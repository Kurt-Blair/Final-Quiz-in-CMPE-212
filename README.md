# Final-Quiz-in-CMPE-212
Java FX Question worth 85% of the final quiz in CMPE 212. 

The FX quiz was to create a BMR Calculator interface on Java FX. The interface had to have the specific interface that I have made with 
all the corresponding text fields, labels, buttons and radio buttons. 

The quiz also gave us the algorithm to a BMR for both men and women that I had to program into the event handler.
